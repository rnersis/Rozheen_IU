Completed parts: set up tapped view as well as tableview and all the necessary UI elements.
Connections are correct since I do get the names already provided, unfortunately for some reason my cell table won't update, in my code I have it to update every time submit is pressed.

I was also working on having a date picker to have the user input the friends Birthday. Unfortunately was unable to do the correct date conversions and had more error to deal with.
